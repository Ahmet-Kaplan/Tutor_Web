        	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">Why We Need Your Personal Information</h2>
        	<br>
        	<p>UPchieve strives to connect students with volunteers who can help you succeed in your classes and in the college application process. However, in order to ensure that you receive personalized help from volunteers, improve the services we offer you, and obtain funding to continue providing these services to you, we have to collect personal information about you. Here are some examples of what we use your personal information to do:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Make your tutoring and college counseling sessions personal</li>
        		<li>Store information from your sessions (we hope to allow you to view past sessions in the future, though this feature is still under development)</li>
        		<li>Contact you about your account and about important updates to UPchieve's services (such as changes to the times our services are available and the addition of new features)</li>
        		<li>Ask you for your feedback to help make our service better</li>
        		<li>Respond to your requests for information or assistance</li>
        		<li>Consolidate anonymized information about students who use our services in order to apply for and maintain funding (statistics such as what percentage of students found our services useful or what percentage of students were part of minority groups can help us obtain funding and ultimately provide you with even better help)</li>
        	</ul>
        	<br>
        	<p>Because we care about your privacy, there are several things we promise we will never do:<p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>We WILL NOT sell your personal information to anyone</li>
        		<li>We WILL NOT send you promotional mail or advertisements</li>
        		<li>We WILL NOT give anyone except key staff members (defined below) and in special cases relevant federal authorities (explained below) access to identifying information, such as your full name, gender, age, high school, or contact information</li>

        	</ul>
        	<br>
        	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">How We Collect Your Personal Information</h2>
        	<br>
        	<p>We collect information about you in the following ways:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Information you give us.</span> For example, in order to use our services, you must sign up for an account. When you do, we ask for your email address and various personal information such as your full name, age, and high school. We also give you the option to provide additional information about your college applications. After each session with a volunteer, we give you the option to provide feedback on the session.</li>
        		<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Information we get from your use of our services.</span> We collect information about which services you use and how you use them.</li>


        	</ul>

        	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">You and Your Parents Control Your Personal Information</h2>
        	<br>
        	<p>You can visit the Your Profile section of this website anytime to see personal information we have collected about you and update it.</p>
        	<br>
        	<p>If you are under age 13, a law called the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) says that we must have a parent's permission before we may collect and use your Personal Information. We will need this permission before we are able to create an account for you or provide you with any tutoring.</p>
        	<br>
        	<p>Note to parents of children under the age of 13: You are welcome to email us at <span><a href="mailto:info@upchieve.org" style="none; font-weight:bold">info@upchieve.org</span> to review any identifiable information we have collected about your child. If you desire, you may request that we delete this information and/or specify that we collect no more of your child's information. Please note that we will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian, and that a request for us to delete all personal information about a child also requires us to cancel the child's account.</p>
        	<br><br>
        	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">Who Has Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
        	<br>
        	<p>So you know how and why we collect information - but who actually has access to it? Don't worry - UPchieve gives staff members and volunteers limited access to your information. In particular:</p>

        	<ul>
        		<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Upchieve Staff Members:</span> Only two staff members, the Executive Director and the Director of Technology, will be able to access all of the information connected to your account. Other UPchieve staff members may receive your name and email address if you use the "Schedule an Admissions Consulting Session" form or the "Contact Us" form on our website.</li>
        		<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Volunteers:</span> Volunteers may view the "College Counseling Information" section of your profile only while they are in a college counseling session with you. After ending the session, volunteers will not be able to view this information or contact you.</li>

        	</ul>
        	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A word of caution: </span>We encourage students to practice internet safety and use caution even when interacting with UPchieve volunteers. Although we do our best to vet all volunteers, we cannot guarantee their intentions or capabilities and therefore strongly encourage you not to share personal or identifying information with volunteers. For more information on best internet safety practices specifically for teens, check out <a href="/" style="none;font-weight:bold">WebMD's article.</p>
        	<br>
        	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Completely anonymized and consolidated information </span>will be shared in our annual reports (which will be available on our website to all visitors) and in our applications for funding. Anonymized and consolidated information means that the information will not pertain to any one individual and it will not be possible to identify any individuals that may or may not be included. For example, we may share statistics such as X percent of students who used our services were the first in their family to attend college or Y percent of students said they thought our services were helpful. If you would like to be excluded from these statistics, please email <span><a href="mailto:info@upchieve.org" style="none; font-weight:bold">info@upchieve.org</span></p>
        	<br>
        	On occassion, we may also ask for your permission to quote feedback from one of your submitted feedback forms. However, we will never share anything from your feedback forms without your prior permission.
